# Logs Page Implementation Walkthrough

I have added a new page to view historical sensor logs and optimized the logging frequency.

## Changes

### 1. Web Server (`web_server.py`)
- Added `/logs` route to serve the logs page.
- Added `/api/logs` endpoint to fetch sensor data as JSON and clear data via DELETE.
- **OPTIMIZATION 1**: Configured `SensorLogger` with `min_interval=60` seconds to prevent log flooding.
- **OPTIMIZATION 2**: Added **Conditional Logging**. The system now checks if any functional button (Lighting, Nebulizer, Heaters, etc.) is active. If all buttons are OFF (standby mode), no logs are recorded.

### 2. Sensor Logger (`lib/data/sensor_logger.py`)
- **NEW**: Added `min_interval` parameter to constructor.
- **NEW**: Implemented debounce logic in `log_if_changed`.
- **NEW**: Added `clear_all_data()` method to delete all records.

### 3. Frontend
- **New Page**: `web/logs.html`
  - Displays a responsive table of sensor readings.
  - **NEW**: Added "Temizle" (Clear) button to delete all history.
  - **NEW**: Added **Language Support (TR/EN)**.
    - Buttons to switch between Turkish and English.
    - Automatically remembers your preference.
  - **FIX**: Improved visibility of "Back" button for light theme.
- **Dashboard**: `web/index.html`
  - Added a "Loglar" (Logs) button to the System Panel.

## Verification
- **Frequency**: Validated 60s minimum interval.
- **Condition**: Validated that `web_server.py` skips logging if `any(button_states.values())` is false.
- **Clearing**: Validated the API and UI flow for clearing logs.
- **Language**: Verified language switching updates all text and persists on reload.

## Next Steps
- Restart the server.
- Open the Logs page and try switching languages.
- Verify that logs stop accumulating when you turn off all buttons.
