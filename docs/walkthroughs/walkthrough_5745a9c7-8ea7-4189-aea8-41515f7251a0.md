# Walkthrough: Waiter Terminal Access Fixed

I have resolved the issue preventing you from accessing the waiter terminal on your Mac.

## Changes Made

### [Kitchen Order Persistence]
- Fixed a bug where previous orders were not visible on the kitchen screen when additions were made.
- Implemented **Initial Sync**: The kitchen screen now loads all active orders upon opening or refreshing.
- Added **Time Persistence**: Order times are now saved in the backend to ensure they display correctly after a refresh.

### [UI Fixes]
- Fixed a bug where **Paket** buttons wouldn't turn red when occupied.
- Adjusted CSS specificity to ensure the `occupied` state overrides the default `paket` styling.

### [Menu Management]
- Created a new **Menü Düzenleme** page accessible via **Ayarlar**.
- Implemented category and item management (add/edit/delete).
- Added `/api/menu/save` backend endpoint that synchronizes with:
    - `menu.txt` file.
    - PostgreSQL database.
    - Real-time client updates via SocketIO.

### [Server Cleanup]
- Cleaned up stuck background processes (PIDs 14243, 14188) that were hogging the ports.
- Restarted `web_server.py` in stable mode (`debug=False`).
- Verified that PID 15962 is now correctly listening on *both* port 8000 and port 5555.

### [Makefile Enhancements]
- Organized the `Makefile` to support both **Windows** and **Unix** (Mac/Linux).
- Added automatic OS detection:
    - On Windows: Uses `.venv\Scripts\python.exe`.
    - On Unix: Uses `.venv/bin/python`.
- `make run` and `make install` commands are now cross-platform.

## Access Instructions

You can access the waiter terminal using the following links:

1. **On this Mac (Browser):**
   - [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

2. **From other devices (Tablets, Phones) on the same Wi-Fi:**
   - [http://192.168.1.196:8000](http://192.168.1.196:8000)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **MacOS Güvenlik Duvarı (Firewall)**: Eğer hala erişemiyorsanız, Mac'inizde **Sistem Ayarları > Ağ > Güvenlik Duvarı > Seçenekler** kısmından **python3** uygulamasına "Gelen bağlantılara izin ver" seçeneğini işaretlediğinizden emin olun.

## Verification

I have verified the server status:
- Port 8000 is active (Web).
- Port 5555 is active (Terminal).
- `make help` correctly detects the platform as "Unix" on this Mac.
- Clean restart confirmed (no duplicate processes).
- `curl` test to localhost returned `200 OK`.
