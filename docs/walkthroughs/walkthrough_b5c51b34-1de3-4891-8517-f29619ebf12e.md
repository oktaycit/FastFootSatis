# Walkthrough - Patient Info i18n and Layout Refinement

I have completed the internationalization of the `patient_info.html` page and refined the button labels on the `index.html` page. Following user feedback, I also reverted the grid layout changes to maintain the original button positioning while keeping the label fixes.

## Changes Made

### Internationalization (i18n)
- **`patient_info.html`**:
    - Added `data-i18n` attributes to all hardcoded Turkish strings in the HTML.
    - Updated the script section to use the central `translations` object for:
        - Validation and success/error messages.
        - The summary display of saved patient data.
        - The print template (dynamically translated based on the current language).
        - Confirmation dialogs (e.g., clearing the form).
        - Sidebar history items and search empty states.
    - Included `script.js` to enable the shared translation system.
- **`script.js`**:
    - Refactored the `translations` object to include all necessary keys for patient information.
    - Corrected inconsistent keys (e.g., `app.patient_title` and `app.settings_title`).
- **`index.html`**:
    - Updated button labels in the "Data Management" and "System Settings" sections to use the correct i18n keys.

### Layout and Quality
- **`styles.css`**:
    - Reverted `.control-grid` and `.target-values` from 3 columns back to 2 columns to keep the original layout as requested.
    - Fixed an "at-rule or selector expected" lint error caused by an extra closing brace.
    - Added the standard `appearance` property for better cross-browser compatibility.

## Verification Results

### Localization
- Verified that all text on `patient_info.html` switches correctly between Turkish and English.
- Confirmed that the print window displays the correct language based on the application's current setting.
- Checked that form validation messages are localized.

### Layout
- Reverted the 3-column layout to the original 2-column layout, ensuring buttons and target values are positioned as expected by the user.

### Code Quality
- All CSS lint errors in `styles.css` have been resolved.
- Scripts in `patient_info.html` now correctly handle language persistence via `localStorage`.

> [!NOTE]
> The print function now uses a slightly longer timeout (500ms) to ensure the dynamically generated content is fully loaded before the print dialog opens.
