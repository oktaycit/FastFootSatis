# Hall Grouping and Table Transfer Walkthrough

I've implemented a robust system for grouping restaurant tables into halls and a seamless table transfer feature.

## Changes Made

### Configuration
- Created [salons.json](file:///Users/oktaycit/Projeler/FastFootSatıs/salons.json) to define halls (e.g., Bahçe, Ana Salon, Teras) and their associated tables.

### Backend
- Updated [web_server.py](file:///Users/oktaycit/Projeler/FastFootSatıs/web_server.py) to:
    - Load salon configurations on startup.
    - Initialize adisyonlar (orders) based on salon tables.
    - Added `transfer_table` SocketIO event to move order items between tables accurately.
    - Included salon information in the initial data sent to clients.

### Frontend
- Updated [index.html](file:///Users/oktaycit/Projeler/FastFootSatıs/web/index.html) to:
    - Add a "MASA TAŞI" button in the order controls.
    - Add a modal for choosing the target table for a transfer.
- Updated [script.js](file:///Users/oktaycit/Projeler/FastFootSatıs/web/script.js) to:
    - Render tables grouped by halls.
    - Implement the logic for opening the transfer modal and confirming table moves via SocketIO.
- Updated [styles.css](file:///Users/oktaycit/Projeler/FastFootSatıs/web/styles.css) to:
    - Stylized the hall headers for a premium, organized look.

## Verification Results

### Hall Grouping
The tables are now successfully organized under their respective hall names:
- **Bahçe:** B1-B5
- **Ana Salon:** 1-15
- **Teras:** T1-T5
- **Paket Servis:** Still functions as a separate section.

### Table Transfer
- Successfully demonstrated moving an order from one table to another.
- The source table is cleared, and all items (including quantities and prices) are merged into the target table.
- Both tables are updated in real-time across all connected terminals.
